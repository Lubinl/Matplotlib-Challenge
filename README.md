## Background

Pymaceuticals

  In this challenge, we charged with taking on the role of a Senior Analyst at a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. The company specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 
  We're given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

My final report will include the following:

- Summary Statistics
- Bar Chart
- Pie Chart
- Quartile/Outlier Calculations
- Boxplot Chart
- Line Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Correlation and Regression plot

We are then instructed to include any findings at the beginning of our notebook.
